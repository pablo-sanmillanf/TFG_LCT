 <body>Okay. <segment id='891' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, we are we are going to start talking about the Raspberry Pi,</segment> 
<segment id='879' features='semantic-density;sd-'>what is the general sense of this of this platform,</segment> 
<segment id='878' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and some additional topics about what is an embedded system</segment>, 
<segment id='880' features='semantic-density;sd--'>different strategies to develop things.</segment> 
Okay. <segment id='881' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, broadly you know that this project was starting in 2006 Okay.</segment>  
<segment id='882' features='semantic-density;sd--'>In UK, okay because one of the motivation of this project was the idea of 
that young people in general don't have enough technological skills related to the use of computers okay.</segment> 
<segment id='883' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, the idea of the British government was to launch something like a very cheap platform 
to help young people even in the in the lower levels of the schools to develop programming application okay 
to develop their stem the typical abilities and skills in Mathematics, Physics and these kinds of things.</segment> 
<segment id='884' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, they just started going on this platform with the idea of in principle to use this only in the British schools, 
but, quickly the platform started to develop a very of course, it's very cheap solution.</segment> 
<segment id='885' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And there are a lot of people interested in in general</segment> <segment id='886' features='semantic-density;sd++'>in the development of embedded application electronic software solution using the Raspberry Pi, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='887' features='semantic-density;sd--'>If you have a look to the to the slide, 
you will see how at the beginning of the project, 
they immediately started to to sell a lot of products, 
and when there goes approximately the number of units that the red Raspberry Pi, 
the foundation of the Raspberry Pi has produced it sold is around 40 million.</segment> 
<segment id='888' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, what is of course is an impressive number, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='889' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It's quite important also to know that finally, I think two years or three years ago, they decided to move to move the production of Raspberry Pi to Wales okay, 
and this is something that is generating an interesting technological area in this part of the of the British, of the British country.</segment> 
Okay. <segment id='892' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, if we have a look to the different models, 
we can discover that this product has a continuous evolution during the different period of times, okay, 
we started at the beginning with a Raspberry Pi version one model B. 
And nowadays we are using models like Raspberry Pi model four, sorry Raspberry Pi four model</segment> <segment id='893' features='semantic-density;sd++'>B 
or even more electronic and embedded systems solutions oriented like the Raspberry Pi computer module or the Raspberry Pi Zero, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='894' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In this course, we are going to use a Raspberry Pi, version three model B plus, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='895' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is the version that we have here 
and is more or less all the hardware is more or less quite similar in terms of performance in terms of peripherals, in terms of possibilities, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='896' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The only difference is is the final performance of the processor,</segment> <segment id='897' features='semantic-density;sd+'>the amount of DDR memory that you have available</segment> <segment id='898' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and these kind of things, 
but the idea of the platform is more or less the same for all the different versions, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='899' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Which are the main elements that we have in this platform?</segment> 
<segment id='900' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The first important point is to mention that we have something that</segment> <segment id='901' features='semantic-density;sd+'>the manufacturer called system on chip</segment>, 
<segment id='902' features='semantic-density;sd--'>is the manufacturer is Broadcom.</segment> 
<segment id='903' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And they are integrated in in the same chip, a GPU, this is a graphical processor unit and a quad core ARM processor.</segment> 
<segment id='904' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so it's a very powerful solution.</segment> 
<segment id='905' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It's not mentioned in this in this figure,</segment> 
<segment id='906' features='semantic-density;sd++'>but they also have in the chip, a DSP a digital signal processor</segment>, 
<segment id='907' features='semantic-density;sd--'>but there's something that Broadcom is not giving information to the developers of how to use this data centre processors 
unless that you contact with them and sign an agreement to develop solutions.</segment> 

[5:00]

<segment id='908' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So for us, the important is that we have in a very cheap solution something that is very affordable,</segment> 
<segment id='909' features='semantic-density;sd++'>we have a quad core solution to develop embedded platform application</segment> <segment id='910' features='semantic-density;sd--'>that we will see later what is the idea.</segment> 
<segment id='911' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay connected to today's chip,</segment> 
<segment id='912' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Broadcom provide also a DDR memory one gigabyte or even two gigabytes of DDR memory 
to store the typical data and code</segment> <segment id='913' features='semantic-density;sd+'>for for your applications in the operating system solution or departmental solution.</segment> 
<segment id='914' features='semantic-density;sd++'>We have a specific chip providing the USB ports and the FMF connection.</segment> 
<segment id='915' features='semantic-density;sd++'>This is a different chip that is connected in the PCB of this electronic system.</segment> 
<segment id='916' features='semantic-density;sd++'>In the Raspberry Pi version three, we have a Wi Fi element in the reading all the hardwired that you need to deploy and use the Wi Fi.</segment> 
<segment id='917' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And of course, we have here different other peripherals that are very useful to develop applications.</segment> 
<segment id='919' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Of course, we have this connection to connect your graphical output, 
we have the option to connect a camera, 
we have an audio output,</segment><segment id='918' features='semantic-density;sd++'> 
we have a micro SD connector to insert the SD card that we will use to boot our operating system solution.</segment> 
<segment id='920' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And finally, we have here a connector, a 40 pins connector in a deal format to connect different GPIO elements I squared C chips, SPI element serial line devices.</segment> 
<segment id='921' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We will use that in our lab okay to connect peripherals and connect sensors to implement application, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='922' features='semantic-density;sd-'>All these elements are available in this platform that I showed you before okay, this platform the Raspberry Pi three model b plus, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='923' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, please if you have questions, no problem, raise your hand and ask.</segment> I proceed. Okay. 
<segment id='924' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, what we have here?</segment> <segment id='925' features='semantic-density;sd--'>More information.</segment> <segment id='926' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This system on chip, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='927' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, with CPU, DSP and GPU and we have different models from Raspberry Pi one Raspberry Pi,</segment> 
<segment id='928' features='semantic-density;sd--'>four different models from Broadcom, this American manufacturer USA manufacturer.</segment> 
<segment id='1' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You have here the versions of the of the processor that we have in the different versions of the Raspberry Pi</segment>, 
<segment id='2' features='semantic-density;sd++'>for our specific Raspberry Pi three, we have a quad core ARM solution, okay, 
running on 1.2 gigahertz, okay with an ARM version eight cores, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='3' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And additionally, we have this GPU is a graphical processing unit 
that is able to run different libraries or binaries that are provided also by Broadcom to accelerate typical video applications.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='4' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this is something that is provided by Broadcom.</segment> 
<segment id='5' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is not open source, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='6' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But it's something that you can use in your application.</segment> 
<segment id='7' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And as I told you before, the system on chip also includes a DSP that is undocumented unless that you contact with Broadcom.</segment> 
<segment id='8' features='semantic-density;sd--'>In that case, if you pay before of course, you get the information to develop.</segment> 
<segment id='9' features='semantic-density;sd++'>One important thing is that the memory the ROM memory, the DDR memory is physically installed in top of the of the chip, okay, on top of the processor 
and for the Raspberry Pi three we have one gigabyte of RAM memory, okay one gigabyte of RAM memory, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='10' features='semantic-density;sd++'>The DSI interfaces typically are working at 10 or 100 megabit per second okay is not able to work out one gigasample per second.</segment> 
<segment id='11' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And the chip that is provided in the this Ethernet connectivity is also giving you the USB connectivity, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='12' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So we have plenty of USB ports to connect keyboards, to connect the mouse or to connect other USB printers.</segment> 
<segment id='13' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We need a simple power supply of five volts to boot the Raspberry Pi Okay.</segment>

<segment id='14' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Be careful with this, because if you connect any specific USB or five volts and you are not providing enough current,</segment> 
<segment id='15' features='semantic-density;sd-'>you will see in the bot a lot of messages messages, giving you feedback about the power supply is not stable, 
you need to give, you need to provide a good power supplier of five volts or with at least two ampers or something like that, something similar, 
to get a Raspberry Pi running at the maximum performance.</segment> 
<segment id='16' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And additionally, we have different interfaces to connect a display, high resolution displays, 
or to connect your typical monitor screens to display your high high resolution graphics, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='17' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So it's a computer in a very simple and a smaller form factor, very cheap for the development of application.</segment> 
<segment id='18' features='semantic-density;sd--'>More things that we have available, we have the option to use a very old interface to connect a video output.</segment> 
<segment id='19' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Of course, we have here an audio connection,</segment> <segment id='20' features='semantic-density;sd-'>the use of an SD card that's crucial for us</segment> 
<segment id='22' features='semantic-density;sd+'>because here we are going to provide the operating system and the programs to to develop our solutions</segment><segment id='21' features='semantic-density;sd++'> 
and this connector this 40 pin connectors in a double row of 20 pins, 
each one with serialized I squared C interface SBI interface.</segment> 
<segment id='23' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, here basically we are going to use these interfaces,</segment> <segment id='24' features='semantic-density;sd+'>the serial line and the I two C interface.</segment> 
<segment id='25' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We are going to connect here the accelerometer and the color sensor 
and we are going to connect here interface and USB to to the serial line interface</segment> <segment id='26' features='semantic-density;sd-'>to connect these to a computer 
to see how the system is configured and to run programs and applications, 
and other things that are available to connect order peripherals.</segment> 
<segment id='27' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, this is the Raspberry Pi with an identification of the different elements.</segment> 
<segment id='28' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And this is the connection that we have in this connector in this 40 pin connector, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='29' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And this is something that will be very familiar for you 
because you will be connecting the different cables to interface the accelerometer and color sensor, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='30' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So this is the hardware.</segment> 
<segment id='31' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So here's my computer or if you want a very powerful microcontroller, if we want to call this microcontroller.</segment> 
<segment id='32' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I don't like to call this microcontroller because we have four cores with a very complex solution.</segment> 
<segment id='33' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But from the point of view of that we have there the peripherals we have the CPU, 
in principle is a very powerful microcontroller, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='34' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, the point is, which are the steps that I need to follow to develop application here are 
probably the first step is to decide which kind of developments we will we want to do.</segment> 
<segment id='35' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Let me explain.</segment> 
<segment id='37' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Typically 99% of applications are going to use an operating system,</segment> <segment id='36' features='semantic-density;sd++'>this operating system typically is Linux and embedded Linux solution, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='38' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We have the option of use the Linus provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation,</segment> <segment id='39' features='semantic-density;sd-'>they call Raspbian is very well documented how to install this, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='41' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You don't need a hard disc, you only need an SD card to install the operating system.</segment> 
<segment id='42' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Typically eight gigabytes is enough.</segment> 
<segment id='43' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I recommend you that you use a high speed SD card, okay, 
because the performance of the system depends on the performance SD card.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='44' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you have here all the tools that you need to develop applications.</segment>

[10:00]

 <segment id='45' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, be careful with this.</segment> 
<segment id='46' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Because this means that we can combine, link and debug programs in the Raspberry Pi.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='47' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is not a standard way that we that we typically follow</segment> <segment id='48' features='semantic-density;sd+'>when we are doing application with microcontrollers 
because we use a computer.</segment> 
<segment id='49' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In one computer we have the compiler, we have the linker, we have the libraries.</segment> 
<segment id='50' features='semantic-density;sd++'>We have the debug tools, 
and what we typically do is to download the code 
and more or less try to implement a remote debugging of that, okay?</segment>

[15:00]

<segment id='51' features='semantic-density;sd++'>But if we use the Raspberry Pi with the operating system with Raspbian 
the Raspbian provide all the compilers, linkers, debuggers, the typical utilities okay.</segment> 
<segment id='52' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, you can develop your applications there and you can run the application there, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='53' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this is the thing that we are going to cover in the first block of the course in the unit one, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='54' features='semantic-density;sd++'>We will develop a C application that is compiled in the Raspberry Pi and is debug in the Raspberry Pi okay.</segment> 
<segment id='55' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is not a professional approach, this is a more or less a getting started approach, okay, not the professional one, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='56' features='semantic-density;sd++'>For example, trying to provide solutions for for IoT application, 
Ubuntu is providing a specific version of Linux or Raspberry Pi for the development of IoT applications.</segment> 
<segment id='57' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so, you having one SD card, all the tools to deploy IoT applications without the need of use of external computers, okay?</segment>  
<segment id='58' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I repeat this will not be our approach because we will use another different approach that is more professional.</segment> 
<segment id='59' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The other option, probably 100% of obligation is used bare metal.</segment> 
<segment id='60' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So this means I forgot to use operating system</segment> <segment id='61' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I don't want to use a commercial solution or, or open source solution, 
I prefer to develop my own my own, and no problem, I can program directly with information</segment> <segment id='62' features='semantic-density;sd+'>using a C compiler and that's all.</segment> 
<segment id='63' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you can imagine that this is not simple.</segment> 
<segment id='65' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And I I think it's preferable to avoid this way of doing the things</segment> 
<segment id='64' features='semantic-density;sd-'>because you are not reusing code and is quite difficult okay.</segment> 
<segment id='66' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But if you have a look at different solutions using the internet, Google and these things, 
you will see that is something that some people is trying to do.</segment> 
<segment id='67' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Some more tools.</segment> 
<segment id='68' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Independently if we are developing bare metal solutions or solutions using Linux, 
we are going to use compilers, linkers on debuggers for ARM processors, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='69' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And we are going mainly programming C and C++, you will see that there are a lot of people programming for the Raspberry Pi using Python.</segment> 
<segment id='70' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But this is for more or less for academic solutions.</segment> 
<segment id='71' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Or for very, very more or less simple solution not for professional applications.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='72' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, this is a first approach of different options to program</segment> <segment id='73' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and to develop application using the Raspberry Pi.</segment> 
<segment id='74' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Do you have questions?</segment> <segment id='75' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Are you understanding me?</segment> <segment id='77' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yeah, sure.</segment> Okay. <segment id='76' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Think about this, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='78' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Because I think that we will have time to discuss about this point later.</segment> 
<segment id='79' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so the main of the course, the name of the course is</segment> <segment id='80' features='semantic-density;sd++'>development of embedded applications, embedded solutions using Raspberry Pi.</segment> 
<segment id='81' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So now we know what what is a Raspberry Pi.</segment> 
<segment id='82' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The other concept is, what is an embedded system?</segment> 
<segment id='83' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Is anybody ready to explain me in one minute, what is an embedded system?</segment> 
<segment id='84' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Or what's your opinion of what an embedded system is?</segment> 
<segment id='85' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Or you have an idea of what's this?</segment> <segment id='86' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Try to speak loader, please.</segment> 

<segment id='87' features='semantic-density;sd++'>STUDENT- So basically, the embedded systems are pieces of code, that are implemented in electronic stuff like, I don't know, TVs or refrigerators</segment>
<segment id='88' features='semantic-density;sd+'>MARIANO- but only pieces of code?</segment>
<segment id='89' features='semantic-density;sd-'>STUDENT- Not only, hardware</segment> <segment id='90' features='semantic-density;sd-'>XX
MARIANO-  that's the point
STUDENT- the scaling of the XX is smaller rather than the software that we use in our,
MARIANO- Okay, good.</segment> <segment id='91' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And the other message is that it's a specific application.</segment> 
<segment id='92' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So we are building a specific hardware solution, 
with a specific software application solving on a specific problem, this is an embedded platform.</segment> 
<segment id='93' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this is something that typically we are not updating, we are not changing everyday.</segment> 
<segment id='94' features='semantic-density;sd+'>An embedded solution typically is not going to reinstall the software remotely or these kinds of things.</segment> 

[20:00]

<segment id='95' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, something that is doing a specific job that the designer has decided
and of course, you can upgrade application and you can change the XX of course,</segment> 
<segment id='96' features='semantic-density;sd-'>but this is something is not on mobile phones in the sense that we are changing everyday application 
and changing everyday the different software solution that we have.</segment> 
<segment id='97' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, considering this an embedded system is something that is specialized in doing something special okay.</segment> 
<segment id='98' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, generally is a computing system, okay, with a specific software application 
and</segment> <segment id='99' features='semantic-density;sd-'>these hardware is connected with an environment 
because we are measuring different physical variables, temperature, humidity, 
how our motor is doing things or how different sensors are giving me for measures.</segment> 
<segment id='100' features='semantic-density;sd+'>An idea is that we are going to develop a software application that is running in this hardware.</segment> 
<segment id='101' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Typically, this embedded system is part of of another more complex electronic system okay.</segment> 
<segment id='102' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And typically, we are providing solutions that are given an answer in real time.</segment> 
<segment id='103' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, I need to generate an answer or a response to a specific event in a specific time.</segment> Okay. <segment id='104' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, an specific time.</segment>  Okay. 
<segment id='105' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And as I told you before, this is something that generally speaking is part of another complex system, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='106' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, for the point of view of example of applications, 
a smartphone is an example of an embedded  system with this assumption that in our mobile phone, we are updating the software every day, okay, 
and this is something that is not very normal in an embedded platform.</segment> 
<segment id='107' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It's more of watches, printers, gaming consoles, wireless routers,
 and in general, all the applications that we see we see today for IoT are in general embedded system oriented applications, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='108' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, at the end of the course, we are going to develop</segment> <segment id='109' features='semantic-density;sd++'>an embedded system using the Raspberry Pi 
with my specific Linux distribution connecting different one accelerometer and one colour sensor sensor.</segment> 
<segment id='110' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And we are going to transmit the information to another computer to make decisions.</segment> 
<segment id='111' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, okay, so, if we have a look to the hardware that we have in an embedded system,</segment> 
<segment id='112' features='semantic-density;sd--'>this is something that probably is quite familiar for you, 
because you have some experienc</segment>e <segment id='113' features='semantic-density;sd+'>using microprocessors, microcontrollers or even more powerful systems.</segment> 
<segment id='114' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So we have a microprocessor, an element that is able to execute a bit of a piece of code writing in a specific language that is specified by the manufacturer.</segment> 
<segment id='115' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We have a program memory and a data memory.</segment> 
<segment id='116' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So this means that we we have two different memories to store the code and data.</segment> 
<segment id='117' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And we have here different peripherals and interfaces to exchange information with other external devices 
using digital input output using analogue input output, 
using timers or using all the peripherals like SPI, I squared, C, etcetera.</segment> 
<segment id='118' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, generally, when you are developing things with microprocessors, the microprocessor is a single core processor.</segment> 
<segment id='119' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, the trend nowadays is that some microcontrollers, some manufacturers like STM is moving to dual core processors.</segment> 
<segment id='120' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But in general, we work with a single processor.</segment> 
<segment id='121' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We have different memory blocks, different peripherals.</segment> 
<segment id='122' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And we use all of these things for the implementation of general purpose application, 
measure analogue signals, interfaces, these digital elements, etcetera.</segment> 
<segment id='123' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Typically we implement these using microcontrollers.</segment> <segment id='124' features='semantic-density;sd--'>That's a typical solution.</segment> 
<segment id='125' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In our case, we are going to change this by a Raspberry Pi.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='126' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So in the Raspberry Pi, we will have an embedded solution to this one.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='128' features='semantic-density;sd--'>From the technical point of view, which are the options that we have nowadays</segment> <segment id='127' features='semantic-density'>to develop embedded solution okay?</segment>

[25:00]

<segment id='129' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, please pay attention to this column first.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='130' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And here we have here different technologies to do things,</segment> <segment id='131' features='semantic-density;sd+'>to implement embedded systems 
and we have here different variables to be considered: 
cost of design, cost of productions, how to upgrade the hardware, the size, the weight, the power and the performance in general the performance of the system.</segment> 
<segment id='132' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And we have different technologies.</segment> 
<segment id='133' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This catalogic so, I developed a specific application using the old method method to develop things, using specific chips.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='134' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Of course, this is only interesting when we have a high budget and we are selling a lot of number of elements.</segment> 
<segment id='135' features='semantic-density;sd++'>One of the typical solution in the market is the use of Field Programmable Gateaways and XX devices.</segment> 
<segment id='136' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Mcroprocessor plus memory plus peripherals.</segment> 
<segment id='137' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This probably the experience that you have.</segment>  
<segment id='138' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The people that have studying in this school has experience with these solutions okay</segment> <segment id='139' features='semantic-density;sd++'>the use of FPGAs or PLDs of high density</segment> <segment id='140' features='semantic-density;sd++'>PLDs, okay
microprocessor and memory plus peripherals, 
okay installing a specific microcontroller 
and finally, an embedded PC okay.</segment> 
<segment id='141' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, more or less the Raspberry Pi is moving in this segment, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='142' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, they are easy to upgrade, 
because typically the theme that we are changing is the software of the application okay.</segment> 
<segment id='143' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, have a look at the content of of this slide later, 
because again, this is a summary of the different technologies that we have.</segment> 
<segment id='144' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Which are the benefit of develop an embedded systems solution?</segment> 
<segment id='145' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The first one is that we have a good performance, a good efficiency.</segment> 
<segment id='146' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This means that for instance in the case of Raspberry Pi, 
if we use a specific embedded Linux solution</segment> 
<segment id='147' features='semantic-density;sd+'>we will reduce the size of application 
and we will improve the execution time of the operating system for instance okay.</segment> 
<segment id='148' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, in that in that sense is more powerful, 
the performance is better that if we use more or less a classical solution</segment> 
<segment id='149' features='semantic-density;sd+'>using a standard our operating system with a classical configuration, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='150' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Another benefit?</segment> <segment id='151' features='semantic-density;sd--'>A lower cost.</segment> 
<segment id='152' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We are using a more computer with a very specific and simple software solution 
and in that sense, this is something that is reducing the manufacturing cost okay.</segment> 
<segment id='153' features='semantic-density;sd--'>If we compare these with other more difficult solutions.</segment> 
<segment id='154' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The option of have more more features in terms of adding more things to the system 
is something that depends on the solution could be not possible okay.</segment> 
<segment id='155' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But depends on the specific implementation that we have in the system.</segment> 
<segment id='156' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In general, the Raspberry Pi does something that is easy to up 
because we have different standard interfaces.</segment> 
<segment id='160' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, adding more functionalities to the system</segment> <segment id='161' features='semantic-density;sd--'>is something that is simple simple to do.</segment> 
<segment id='159' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And better dependability.</segment> 
<segment id='162' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So what means this?</segment> <segment id='163' features='semantic-density;sd--'>What means this sorry?</segment> 
<segment id='164' features='semantic-density;sd-'>If we think in terms in terms of failure, 
in the integrity of the system, 
in an embedded system, 
this is something that is very very wrong 
in terms that we have generally hardware that is very well known 
and the software in general is very simple, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='165' features='semantic-density;sd++'>If you compare that for instance with a solution that is using a higher power system 
or a computer system with a very complicated operating system 
and a very complicated software applications, 
then the debugging of the system to obtain a system that is stable and is free of failures is more difficult.</segment> 
<segment id='166' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So in an embedded system is something that is you can repeat, 
you can control and in general we can say that is something that is free, in general of failure,</segment> <segment id='167' features='semantic-density;sd-'>okay, 
considering that the hardware and the software is correctly are correctly designed, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='168' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Typical functions of an embedded systems that you can develop, for example, with a Raspberry Pi.</segment>

[30:00]

<segment id='169' features='semantic-density;sd+'>control systems, because it's quite easy to measure different physical variables 
and depending on the values that you get, you can activate different actuator.</segment> 
<segment id='171' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, in that sense is quite easy</segment> <segment id='170' features='semantic-density;sd++'>to develop closed loop control systems.</segment> 
<segment id='172' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Quite simple to develop applications that are generated under specific sequence of operation 
because as we are programming, we can decide the condition of our system 
depending on the different phases of our specific solution.</segment> 
<segment id='173' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Signal processing, you can acquire your signals from your analogue element, 
you can use these POWER processors that you have there to run a specific software algorithms, 
even artificial intelligence algorithms, 
so you can implement powerful signal processing applications.</segment> 
<segment id='174' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And finally, communication and networking as soon as we have FML and wireless,</segment> 
<segment id='175' features='semantic-density;sd+'>it's quite easy to get data from external sensors and send information to the to the cloud 
or to other microcontrollers 
or to other computers using the Wi Fi or Ethernet 
or serial lines that we have available in the platform.</segment> 
<segment id='176' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, in that sense is an interesting approach for the development of applications.</segment> 
<segment id='177' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Some constraints, of course, the cost.</segment> 
<segment id='178' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is approved generally is very competitive, of course, 
in the case that we use more or less commercial platforms</segment>, l<segment id='179' features='semantic-density;sd+'>ike the Raspberry Pi,</segment> <segment id='180' features='semantic-density;sd--'>quite quite cheap to develop things.</segment> 
<segment id='181' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, the size and weight of course is very well controlled, 
because we are talking about small problems.</segment> 
<segment id='182' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So the weight is not is not a problem in general 
depending on the application the power could be a problem, 
but in general</segment>, <segment id='183' features='semantic-density;sd++'>this is a low power consumption hardware 
this is not a desktop computer, this is not a laptop, this is on a small embedded system.</segment> 
<segment id='184' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And if we play with with the use of sleep mode and reduction of the energy 
we can extend the battery capacity a lot of time 
and in principle,</segment> <segment id='185' features='semantic-density;sd-'>there is no problem with adapting our hardware to a normal environment</segment><segment id='186' features='semantic-density;sd--'>, 
the typical environment of the industry working with the typical temperatures, okay.</segment>  
<segment id='187' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Of course, depending on these constraints on your specific application</segment><segment id='188' features='semantic-density;sd--'>, 
you have to balance what is the best solution that you have to follow.</segment> 
<segment id='190' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You have microcontrollers,</segment> <segment id='191' features='semantic-density;sd--'>you know very well probably that solution.</segment> 
<segment id='192' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You have programming this that those microcontrollers using C or C++, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='193' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In general we use C and C++ because the compiler is providing us a very good solution.</segment> 
<segment id='194' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In the past it was quite common to develop things in Java for a specific solution,</segment> 
<segment id='195' features='semantic-density;sd++'>but the market now is in C C++ 
around 90 99 95% of applications are developing C or C++ in C++ in the embedded market.</segment> 
<segment id='196' features='semantic-density;sd-'>If you have performance issues, you can move to assembly 
but this is something that is very very strange is not typical.</segment> 
<segment id='197' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, in the case of the solution body metal embedded system, 
typically the parameter application is used for very low low power consumption solutions.</segment>  
<segment id='198' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And it's the typical solution when you when you need to do something that is quite quite simple.</segment>
<segment id='199' features='semantic-density;sd--'>As soon as you increase the complexity of the system,</segment> 
<segment id='200' features='semantic-density;sd+'>you move to a use of the operating system and the market now has two different approaches: 
the use of embedded system solutions</segment> <segment id='201' features='semantic-density;sd--'>is the approach that we are going to use here</segment> 
<segment id='202' features='semantic-density;sd++'>or the use of a specific real time operating system 
uses for instance for for the case of ARM, 
the use of CNCS head-toes solutions using FDX 
or using free or RDOS okay.</segment> 
<segment id='203' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But we are going to work with this option: a customize link, an embedded link.</segment> 
<segment id='204' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, embedded software?</segment> <segment id='205' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What is embedded software?</segment> 
<segment id='206' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It's a software that is running in an embedded platform a hardware platform.</segment> 
<segment id='207' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In principle is a software that is oriented to 
development to the development of a specific application to control a machine or device.</segment> 

[35:00]

<segment id='208' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Something that is not general purpose, 
something very specialized with some limit memory requirements.</segment> 
<segment id='209' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, we are not consuming a big amount of memory,</segment> 
<segment id='210' features='semantic-density;sd+'>sometimes this doesn't require an operating system 
or sometimes depends on the application,</segment> <segment id='211' features='semantic-density;sd--'>subject to timing constraints 
because we probably will need to meet some real time limits 
or some or some real time goals, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='212' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And in general something that is not requiring the use of a person in front of the system to make a decision 
because the decisions are are made by the following XX with the help of this XX</segment> , okay. 
<segment id='214' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What is the typical approach to develop these embedded software solutions?</segment> 
<segment id='216' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We can start playing with the idea of developing a specific solution for my specific hardware okay, 
but in that case, you need to have a very good knowledge of the hardware.</segment> 
<segment id='217' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, that's difficult and typically what we try to do is to apply any kind of any kind of abstraction 
sorry to simplify the software development okay.</segment> 
<segment id='218' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, in general, we are going to use the hardware trying to avoid the low level details,</segment> <segment id='219' features='semantic-density;sd--'>okay, 
you will see this very, very, in a very straightforward way</segment> 
<segment id='220' features='semantic-density;sd++'>when we start using the I2C interface in Linux</segment>, 
<segment id='221' features='semantic-density;sd--'>because you will see that this is a very good way</segment> <segment id='222' features='semantic-density;sd+'>to use the interface with the hardware</segment> 
<segment id='223' features='semantic-density;sd--'>with a very good level of abstraction Okay, avoiding the use of problems.</segment> 
<segment id='224' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The responsiveness of the system, okay something that we can control 
because we don't have very huge number of software layers.</segment> 
<segment id='225' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, as soon as we are moving our application very close to the hardware, 
the triggers can be detected immediately 
and we can respond in a very agile way reducing the latency of the system.</segment> 
<segment id='226' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We can manage the concurrency that this is something that is difficult to implement in a microcontroller 
unless that you have an operating system.</segment> 
<segment id='227' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, in Linux,</segment> <segment id='228' features='semantic-density;sd--'>this is something that is very simple, very simple,</segment> 
<segment id='229' features='semantic-density;sd+'>because as we have the operating system, we can launch different threads in parallel.</segment> 
<segment id='230' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And we can manage different different physical events that are more or less simultaneous</segment> 
<segment id='231' features='semantic-density;sd+'>using this ability of the operating system.</segment> 
<segment id='232' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The reliability that's a problem because if we have issues with the gold or with the hardware, 
we can generate catastrophic problems to the installation.</segment> 
<segment id='233' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, the reliability is a problem.</segment> 
<segment id='234' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But again as we are reducing the software layers 
and we are using a very well known hardware</segment>, 
<segment id='236' features='semantic-density;sd-'>we are simplifying their estimation of these values 
and we are reducing the probability of failure 
and with that, we are improving the reliability of the system.</segment> 
<segment id='235' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And the efficiency.</segment> 
<segment id='237' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Of course, if we are using an SD card instead of a hard disc,</segment> 
<segment id='238' features='semantic-density;sd++'>if we are using this powerful processor that we have in the RBI 
where we are managing the different power modes,</segment> 
<segment id='239' features='semantic-density;sd-'>we are reducing the consumption of energy 
and of course we are improving the efficiency of the system okay, difficult to see now.</segment> 
<segment id='240' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is something that you typically you have to discuss</segment> 
<segment id='241' features='semantic-density;sd-'>when you are developing a specific application.</segment>
Okay. <segment id='242' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So we have the hardware, we have the software we have tools to develop applications.</segment> 
<segment id='243' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Typically a C compiler, linker and a debugger.</segment> 
<segment id='244' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The debugger must be connected to the hardware, okay, a
nd the question here in this course is: 
okay, how we are going to debug applications here with a Raspberry Pi?</segment> 
<segment id='245' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The interfaces that typically we have in our embedded platform with a microcontroller 
are specific hardware interfaces provided by the manufacturer.</segment> 
<segment id='246' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For instance, some of you have experience using the SD microcontrollers 
and the recently specific interface to interface the debug solution okay.</segment> 
<segment id='248' features='semantic-density;sd++'>But in the case of the Raspberry Pi, we are going to use the Ethernet interface 
and the serial line interface to provide the debugging, okay.</segment> 

[40:00]

<segment id='249' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, the strategy to develop and develop solutions 
will be a little bit different</segment> <segment id='250' features='semantic-density;sd+'>of the solution use in microcontrollers.</segment>
<segment id='251' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, we will talk about this in the future, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='252' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, if you mix all this information and you shake your brain, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='253' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Now, what I want to do is an exercise of make some decisions 
about what are the tools that we are going to use here, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='254' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, now, we have a Raspberry Pi with an ARM multi core platform integrated in the Broadcom chip, 
we have an I2C interface that we will use to connect two sensors, 
we are going to develop an NVIDIA Linux operating systems bared solutions to run our applications.</segment> 
<segment id='255' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, with that, we are going to build more or less than a standard embedded platform 
with a standard embedded software solution that is the embedded Linux.</segment> 
<segment id='256' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, a customized Linux for my application and in top of that, 
we will develop application in C or C++ okay using the GNU tools, compiler, linker and the GDB debugger 
we will use Ethernet as an integral line to develop the applications okay.</segment> 
<segment id='257' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And finally, we will be doing developments using Eclipse 
to compile our applications leave the application and debug remotely in the Raspberry Pi 
that will be our approach, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='258' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Completely different of the things that you are studying</segment> <segment id='259' features='semantic-density;sd+'>micro processors or micro processor system base</segment> 
<segment id='260' features='semantic-density;sd+'>that you are using a very specific hardware with a very specific tool provided by the manufacturer 
that is allowing you to debug a very simple solution.</segment> 
<segment id='261' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Here the advantage is that we have the Linux kernel 
and with that I have TCP IP communications using cable or wireless interfaces, 
I have access to SPI, I2C and other serial lines and typical protocols okay.</segment> 
<segment id='262' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, for me is quite straightforward to develop applications</segment> <segment id='263' features='semantic-density;sd--'>in this point 
and this is something that the manufacturers are doing in the market okay</segment>, 
<segment id='264' features='semantic-density;sd+'>use the Linux installed in a specific hardware platform to develop application.</segment> 
<segment id='265' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Are you understanding  me please?</segment>
<segment id='266' features='semantic-density;sd--'>STUDENT-  yes 
MARIANO- yes?</segment> <segment id='267' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Questions?</segment> <segment id='268' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this is one approach okay.</segment> 
<segment id='269' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Probably if we discuss in one week, you can do it, you will find different approaches to do it okay.</segment> 
<segment id='270' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But this is one approach that by the way is very common in the industry.</segment> <segment id='271' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay?</segment> 
<segment id='272' features='semantic-density;sd--'>No questions? No?</segment> <segment id='273' features='semantic-density;sd--'>No questions? Okay.</segment> 
<segment id='274' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So market trends.</segment> <segment id='275' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, what means these?</segment> 
<segment id='276' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, what is the themes now the manufacturers are doing now, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='277' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I want to show you this monster okay.</segment> <segment id='278' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is a monster of the technology.</segment> 
<segment id='279' features='semantic-density;sd++'>It this is what ceilings called called calls the AC AP pick up solutions.</segment> 
<segment id='280' features='semantic-density;sd--' comment='About terminology used'>And this monster if you allow me the use of this terminology,</segment> <segment id='281' features='semantic-density;sd++'>this complex platform has: 
here you can see that a dual cord Cortex A processor, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='282' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Or something similar to the processor that you have in a in a mobile phone.</segment> 
<segment id='283' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, a Cortex air is a specific real time processor is not a Cortex M, 
you have follow the microprocessor course here at UPM you know and a Cortex M platform, 
this is a Cortex air solution oriented to real time application.</segment> 
<segment id='284' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Here we have a very complex logic, XX logic, equivalent to a very powerful API.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='285' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Here we have a specific hardware to run silence codes, the artificial intelligence engines okay.</segment> 
<segment id='286' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Subfield devoted to implement algorithms to run neural network.</segment> 
<segment id='287' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, that is quite common today.</segment> <segment id='292' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And this is typically they are integrating 60, 64</segment> 

[45:00]

<segment id='289' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Depends on the on the model of the chip that you that you buy.</segment> 
<segment id='290' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this kind of this kind of engine.</segment> 
<segment id='291' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And additionally, a specific DSP engines 
that are more oriented to signal processing to audio application and video application.</segment> 
<segment id='293' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so, artificial intelligence cores, audio and video processing engines, programmable hardware 
to deploy your specific applications.</segment> 
<segment id='294' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The typical application to run an embedded Linux platform on an Android solution, 
but typically an embedded platform here.</segment> 
<segment id='295' features='semantic-density;sd++'>A Cortex solution running and CNCs.</segment> 
<segment id='296' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So another kind of embedded system solution more oriented to real time real real time applications.</segment>
<segment id='297' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And all these elements are connected to something</segment> <segment id='298' features='semantic-density;sd+'>that they call network on chip.</segment> 
<segment id='299' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so the network is on, in this case, in the chip inside the chip.</segment> 
<segment id='300' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so when you programme all these elements, 
and you move the information from one site to another site, 
and you implement very complex solutions.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='301' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And here, in the bottom part of this video, 
you have the different interfaces and the different memory elements.</segment> 
<segment id='302' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And you can see here that the technology is moving to 40 gigabyte Ethernet connections, 
100 gigabyte Ethernet connection, 
400 gigabyte Ethernet connections,</segment> 
<segment id='303' features='semantic-density;sd--'>this is quite expensive, by the way.</segment> 
<segment id='304' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, we're talking about 1000 euros per component.</segment> 
<segment id='305' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So if you want you can buy one of these, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='307' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Quite expensive, but these are top of the technology, 
but I want to call your attention that this is very complex,</segment><segment id='306' features='semantic-density;sd+'> 
by by the solution provided by the manufacturer is running here, in the embedded Linux.</segment> 
<segment id='308' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, because the embedded Linux is the element that is controlling all the application.</segment> 
<segment id='309' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, more or less, the heart of the system.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='310' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So it's a very, very interesting platform for the future, 
because this is something that is available in the market.</segment> 
<segment id='311' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I think that since the middle of 2020.</segment> 
<segment id='312' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so it's a very new, very new platform.</segment> 
<segment id='313' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Something something equivalent from the other manufacturer of these kinds of technologies Intel is providing 
it's not as complex as the other solution</segment>, 
<segment id='315' features='semantic-density;sd++'>because they are only integrating the BGA part, 
and the processor part and some high speed technologies interfaces.</segment> 
<segment id='316' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But in the end is the same idea.</segment> 
<segment id='317' features='semantic-density;sd++'>We have a multi core ARM processor, running an embedded solution.</segment> 
<segment id='318' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And if you want to play with this hardware to develop application,</segment> 
<segment id='319' features='semantic-density;sd+'>the first thing that you need to know is how to develop an embedded Linux platform.</segment> 
<segment id='320' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You'll see the instruction there and you'll see what's this?</segment> 
<segment id='314' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you see that.</segment> 
<segment id='321' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And what's the way to program the application here?</segment> 
<segment id='322' features='semantic-density;sd++'>To use C and C++ using Eclipse, 
and you develop your applications 
and you download your applications to that 
to these embedded Linux solution that is right there, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='323' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this is something that in the market is quite interesting, it's a very hot topic.</segment> 
<segment id='324' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And if you have a look to the company that are trying to hire people, you will see that 
this is something that is a topic that the companies are very, very interested in 
new engineers managing this technology.</segment> 
Okay. <segment id='325' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, So, with this in mind, and after this brainstorming of ideas, 
I would like that you think in the following questions, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='326' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And try to search for an answer of these questions that I would like to discuss with you next week.</segment> 
<segment id='327' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so, the idea is a have a look, search for the information 
using the internet using Google or other tools that you consider interesting, 
and have a look to find details additional details 
and discuss about what means this, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='328' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, the Raspberry Pi three, what is the architecture that we have there?</segment> 

[50:00]

<segment id='329' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, there's an ARM processor 
but have a look to that, 
if this is a 32 bit or 64 bit core, what means bar meta programming?</segment> 
<segment id='330' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And in this sense, what software tools are required to implement this bare metal programming?</segment> 
<segment id='331' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Have a look to this and you will and you will find, you will see very, very freaky solutions.</segment> 
<segment id='332' features='semantic-density;sd--'>What are the advantages 
and this is the important point 
what are the advantages and disadvantages</segment> <segment id='333' features='semantic-density;sd+'>of using bare metal programming versus operating system programming?</segment> 
<segment id='334' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is something that I I that we want that you think about it 
because is the origin of this course, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='336' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, we are not using the embedded Linux solution by itself,</segment> <segment id='337' features='semantic-density;sd--'>we are using this 
because we consider that this is something very flexible 
</segment><segment id='338' features='semantic-density;sd+'>to develop solutions in the not only in the electronic market, 
but also in general embedded platform solutions, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='339' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, think about it and give us your opinion about this.</segment>  
<segment id='342' features='semantic-density;sd++'>More questions, what are typical what are the typical compiler and leaker that you using a Linux operating system?</segment> 
<segment id='341' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What are the tools used to compile and link a program?</segment> 
<segment id='343' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Options, but you have to do this: 
review the concept of compiler and link</segment> 
<segment id='344' features='semantic-density;sd--'>because probably if I asked you about this I will find some misunderstandings about this, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='345' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And it's something that you are going to use a lot during this course.</segment> 
<segment id='346' features='semantic-density;sd+' comment='Meaning of word'>What means compile?</segment> 
<segment id='347' features='semantic-density;sd+' comment='Meaning of word'>What means link?</segment> 
<segment id='348' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And this different compiler and this differently link.</segment> 
<segment id='349' features='semantic-density;sd-' comment='Meaning of word'>What is a library?</segment> 
<segment id='350' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Have you ever used before a library to programme something?</segment> Yes? No? 
<segment id='351' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In that case in that case which are the extensions that these domes libraries have?</segment> Okay? 
<segment id='352' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What is the purpose of the Linus make command?</segment> 
<segment id='353' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This will be something magic that we are we are going to use along the course, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='354' features='semantic-density;sd+'>How to use to use the main tools to compile to link and to deploy applications?</segment> 
<segment id='355' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And in that sense, a make is using a make file, what is a make file?</segment> 
<segment id='356' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And what is the purpose of that?</segment> 
<segment id='357' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You know all of these concepts are very familiar for you 
because you have been developing applications for microcontrollers.</segment> 
<segment id='358' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, the idea is to more or less to put the information in parallel 
and we are working with a different solution okay.</segment> 
<segment id='359' features='semantic-density;sd++'>What means user space and kernel space in Linux?</segment> 
<segment id='360' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Of course, this is new for you.</segment> 
<segment id='361' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Because kernels means develop things inside the operating system 
and user space means to develop application in a user level.</segment> 
<segment id='362' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, have a look to that.</segment> 
<segment id='371' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What is a GPU?</segment> 
<segment id='364' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I mentioned before the graphic processor unit.</segment> 
<segment id='365' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You know that this is very common today 
because I don't know if anybody of you</segment> <segment id='366' features='semantic-density;sd+'>is developing mining applications to earn money with bitcoins probably yes.</segment> 
<segment id='367' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But this is something that is very common.</segment> 
<segment id='368' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So is this a training technology that you find system on chip with GPUs 
implementing neural network solutions for graphic algorithms 
and in general is a compute unit okay.</segment> 
<segment id='369' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In that sense, what are the main advantages of using GPU?</segment> 
<segment id='372' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Advantages and of course disadvantages.</segment> 
<segment id='373' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What is the typical programming method to develop application with GPUs?</segment> 
<segment id='374' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so think about this because you will have to submit the questions to Moodle.</segment> 
<segment id='375' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, and we'll open up a chat with a very simple opinion from you about this.</segment> 
Okay. <segment id='376' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And work that you need to follow after this.</segment> 
<segment id='377' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In Moodle, you have a document that is called Getting started with a Raspberry Pi document.</segment> 
<segment id='378' features='semantic-density;sd-'>It's a wonderful , it's a PDF document, sorry.</segment> 
<segment id='379' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Read and study the content.</segment> 
<segment id='380' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Download and install Raspbian on your Raspberry Pi,</segment> 
<segment id='381' features='semantic-density;sd--'>later we are going to give you the material, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='382' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The only material additional material that you need is an SD card.</segment> 
<segment id='383' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So you need to download the Raspbian operating system from the internet.</segment> 
<segment id='384' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, put the image on the SD card and boot the Raspberry Pi.</segment> 

[55:00]

<segment id='385' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, please check the information that will be available on the Moodle site 
about the work that we are going to complete during the next week.</segment> 
<segment id='386' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It's a very simple program, 
but I need that more or less you understand all the steps that we are going to follow.</segment>
<segment id='387' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Do you have questions?</segment> No? <segment id='388' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Sure, no questions?</segment> <segment id='389' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Everything is clear?</segment> Yes? 
<segment id='390' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You are not telling the truth [LAUGHS].</segment> <segment id='391' features='semantic-density;sd--'>For sure.</segment> <segment id='392' features='semantic-density;sd--'>No questions?</segment> 
<segment id='393' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Remember, you need to buy an SD card.</segment> 
<segment id='394' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, and my recommendation is that at least buy a couple of SD cards 
because we are going to use one for the Raspbian and the other one for the Raspberry Pi.</segment> 
<segment id='395' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Sorry for the embedded Linus for the Raspberry Pi.</segment> 
<segment id='398' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And sometime probably you will need to check that your hardware is working well,</segment><segment id='397' features='semantic-density;sd++'> 
and one of the option is to use the Raspbian to boot and verify that your Raspberry Pi's working one.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='399' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is a recommendation, if you don't want, no problem, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='400' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For the embedded Linus solution, if you have an old SD card is enough.</segment> 
<segment id='401' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So if you recycle one of the old SD cards of 52 megabytes or 64 megabytes that nowadays are useless for a mobile phone.</segment> 
<segment id='402' features='semantic-density;sd+'>That's a great solution for the embedded platform.</segment> 
<segment id='403' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But for the Raspbian, no, I prefer that you use, of course it's much bigger SD card 
and you need at least eight gigabytes.</segment> 
<segment id='404' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And if you use our high speed SD card is fantastic 
because you will see that the Raspberry Pi is running very very well.</segment> 
<segment id='405' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay and the performance is very, very good.</segment> 
<segment id='406' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so we have 10 minutes of break and we will do the last presentation today about today</segment> <segment id='411' features='semantic-density;sd+'>about the use of githubs,</segment> <segment id='412' features='semantic-density;sd--'>okay, 
and later we will give you the material okay.</segment> <segment id='407' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So thank you!</segment>

[58:00]

<segment id='408' features='semantic-density;sd--'>2nd Session
Okay, so must fortunately last presentation today, okay, 
and sorry for this amount of information, 
but is the first day we have to start talking about different topics 
and it's the first day, 
so we have to come to use all the time available.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='409' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So the idea is that during the course, okay</segment>, <segment id='410' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I encourage you to use the git, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='413' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The reason is simple.</segment> 
<segment id='414' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Traditionally, you most part of our students typically develop applications, 
doing different kinds of programming techniques.</segment> 
<segment id='415' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And people just do a copy on a copy and a copy and a compressed file compressed file 
and it's is impossible to track the evolution of the code, okay, 
and it's impossible to solve problems, 
as soon as you are developing a complex application, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='416' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So the idea is, is that you try to use an external tool to</segment>, 
<segment id='417' features='semantic-density;sd+'>to have your code control it, in this case, git, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='418' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this will be very useful for two reasons.</segment> 
<segment id='419' features='semantic-density;sd-'>First for you, because as soon as you are doing changes, 
if you if these changes are, say are safe in your system, you can check the evolution of your code.</segment> 
<segment id='40' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But it's very useful for me to verify the different steps that you are doing.</segment> 
<segment id='189' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And if you report a problem, 
I can find a solution in a more simple way</segment> <segment id='157' features='semantic-density;sd-'>that you deliver me a folder with a lot of code, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='213' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Probably some of you don't have experience using this.</segment> 
<segment id='215' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So the idea to today is to do a short presentation of this 
with the aim of use this during the course, the step by step 
and I hope that at the end of the course,</segment> 
<segment id='247' features='semantic-density;sd-'>you we will be able to do a simple management of this only for control your code.</segment> Okay. 

[60:00]

<segment id='288' features='semantic-density;sd-'>How many of you have experience using git? two?</segment> Okay. <segment id='335' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, 20% more or less.</segment> Perfect. Okay. 
<segment id='340' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, what's, what's a git?</segment> 
<segment id='363' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This is a version control system.</segment> 
<segment id='370' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, the idea basically is to control source code 
and to control the evolution, the changes that we have in the code, 
okay, this is one of the objectives.</segment> 
<segment id='396' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The other objective is that this allows to work in parallel in the implementation of XX.</segment> 
<segment id='420' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, this means that if we are working in a couple and we are developing a project together,</segment> 
<segment id='421' features='semantic-density;sd-'>we can modify the source code of our applications 
and we can integrate the application in a very simple way.</segment> 
<segment id='422' features='semantic-density;sd-'>That's the idea, avoiding conflicts and avoiding problems, and easy, 
this is why these collaborative tools are very frequent today 
in the programming or in general in software, developing techniques.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='423' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Typically, typically is a scale that is required by companies independently 
if you are working in software project or in hardware projects, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='424' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, it is something that is today's mandatory, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='425' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, what is the idea?</segment> 
<segment id='426' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The idea is that we can register the evolution of of the source code in general generally, 
we are working with code that is written in text files, 
so, we can verify the syntax and the evolution of the code, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='427' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We can work with different evolutions or different version of this code.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='428' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The idea is that we can develop my basic application 
and as soon as I'm progressing in the development of application, 
I can generate different releases of my software for my clients or for my other users, etc.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='429' features='semantic-density;sd--'>We will see that in detail in the next lecture, in the next week.</segment> 
<segment id='430' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Tools available.</segment> 
<segment id='431' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Forget this one because it's very old,</segment> 
<segment id='432' features='semantic-density;sd+'>typically in the industry people is working now with SVM</segment>.
<segment id='433' features='semantic-density;sd-'>It's a very old tool but is currently in use in some labs and some companies 
but most of people is working with git.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='434' features='semantic-density;sd++'>For instance, when we start using build route, 
we will see that Build Route basically is connecting to different GitHub Git labs 
or in general git repositories</segment> 
<segment id='435' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And it's downloading copies of that code to a local repository.</segment> Okay? 
<segment id='436' features='semantic-density;sd-'>It's essentially the same that that you do 
when you go to a website and you download code locally, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='437' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is the tool, that we have to send as a reference for the course.</segment> 
<segment id='438' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Who are who was the developer of these tools?</segment> 
<segment id='439' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This crazy guy Torvalds Linus, I probably you know him, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='440' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Very famous, it's a poor guy, okay, with no money with no resources, 
but he's the head of the development of all the work related with the Linux XX, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='441' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Of course, git is open source, and it's available for a lot of platform Windows, Linux, etc Okay.</segment> 
<segment id='442' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, in your computer in the Windows the station that you have here you have in this lab, 
you have the Git client is installed on that Windows okay?</segment> 
<segment id='443' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I mean the Linux virtual machine, Ubuntu Linux virtual machine 
that you will be using in the following weeks, 
the Git will be installed there, okay, you have to install it, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='444' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, you can develop application in different languages.</segment> 
<segment id='445' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, we are we are going to work with C or C++ for our development</segment> 
<segment id='446' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and you can have multiple people working in the project developing specific parts of the project 
and you can in any moment, check a version of the status of the project, 
compiling the complete project and verify if the project is working or not.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='447' features='semantic-density;sd--'>We will see later.</segment> 
<segment id='448' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Where the repositories will be located?</segment> 

[65:00]

<segment id='449' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We will use typically we have three options, Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub, and others.</segment> 
<segment id='450' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Probably some of you are using GitHub or GitLab or even GitHub, BitBucket.</segment> 
<segment id='451' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I propose you the use of Bitbucket, okay, the free version of Bitbucket is an option,</segment> 
<segment id='452' features='semantic-density;sd--'>don't worry if you use another one, 
but the idea is that you create a repository here 
and you share the repository with my colleague Miguel Ángel and myself, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='453' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And in that way we can check the evolution of your project.</segment>
<segment id='454' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Again select what tool you prefer to implement the solution.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='455' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, concepts.</segment> 
<segment id='456' features='semantic-density;sd-' comment='&quot;That we call&quot;'>We sometimes we have something that we call repository, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='457' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But this is something that is located somewhere, okay, typically, in the cloud, 
containing the different files of your project.</segment> 
<segment id='458' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And typically, what we are going to store there are is generally the source code, not the binary, okay, 
but source code and all the additional files that you need to build your application.</segment> 
<segment id='459' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, and the instructions to install, to compile, to link and to deploy your application.</segment> 
<segment id='461' features='semantic-density;sd--'>That's the idea. Okay.</segment> 
<segment id='460' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We will have the options to check or to verify the different versions that we have a one file, okay, 
and you will see how to track the evolution of your code.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='462' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And typically, depending on the complexity of the project, 
you can have multiple repositories for your project.</segment> 
<segment id='463' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Important, we will have something that we call their remote repository.</segment> 
<segment id='464' features='semantic-density;sd+'>That is something that will be allocated in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or whatever you want.</segment> 
<segment id='465' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Again, I propose Bitbucket connect to Bitbucket, 
register an account and create your first repository there.</segment> 
<segment id='466' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Additionally, apart from this remote repository, you will have a local repository 
that will be a local copy or something that is typically in the cloud.</segment> 
<segment id='467' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You will you will download a copy of the remote repository something that we call clone.</segment> 
<segment id='468' features='semantic-density;sd-' comment='language'>Clone is copy.</segment> <segment id='469' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Make a copy of something.</segment> 
<segment id='470' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You we'll be working with this local repository making changes to the code.</segment>
<segment id='471' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Changes by changing the code, 
I compile the code in the code I verify that things are working correctly.</segment> 
<segment id='472' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And once I'm happy with the result of something</segment>, 
<segment id='473' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I can create something that we call commit.</segment> 
<segment id='474' features='semantic-density;sd++'>For instance, I'm communicating with accelerometer sensor 
and I've been able to communicate with the sensor and identify the sensor.</segment> 
<segment id='475' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And I built a very simple program with four functions.</segment> 
<segment id='476' features='semantic-density;sd++'>I can make a commit a commit to my local repository saying something that</segment>: 
<segment id='477' features='semantic-density;sd-'>this is my first example communicating with the sensor, for instance, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='479' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, once I'm happy with something that I've completed, locally, in my computer, 
I have the options to push or to publish that to the global repository or to the remote repository, okay, 
and make these available in the remote repository.</segment> 
<segment id='480' features='semantic-density;sd+'>That is something that we call push, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='481' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Imagine that two of you are working in the same project, 
you can have your own local repository 
and you are implementing the communication with the accelerometer.</segment> 
<segment id='482' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And your colleague is developing the communication with a color sensor.</segment> 
<segment id='484' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If you do the things correctly, you will do a clone to have a local copy, 
you will implement the color sensor, one of you, 
the other one, the accelerometer, 
when some of you make the commit will be saving the changes of the part.</segment> 
<segment id='486' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And when the other is developing the color sensor will save the changes of that other part.</segment> Okay. 

[70:00]

<segment id='487' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And finally, both developers can have the same code of the application working and tested.</segment> 
<segment id='488' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Both of them know very well the evolution of the project.</segment> 
<segment id='489' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, so here we have clone and commit, clone to download the project locally, 
commit to put the changes locally, 
push to publish the change in the repository.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='490' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And here automatically arise one question.</segment> 
<segment id='491' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, what happened if I try to upload my color sensor version of the code 
and my colleague has previously uploaded their changes about the accelerometer.</segment> 
<segment id='492' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Don't worry, because the tool is going to complain about</segment> 
<segment id='497' features='semantic-density;sd+'>you're trying to push a copy of something</segment> <segment id='498' features='semantic-density;sd--'>that you don't have the latest version, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='493' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Both of you are trying to do the same thing okay.</segment> 
<segment id='494' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Of course, you cannot do both things simultaneously.</segment> 
<segment id='495' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, the first one gaining the repository will do a push 
and automatically the other colleague</segment> <segment id='499' features='semantic-density;sd+' comment='push / pul SD+'>when he tries to do the push</segment> <segment id='500' features='semantic-density;sd--'>your will see a mail message, 
that be careful you don't have the latest copy.</segment> 
<segment id='501' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So please pull to obtain the last version.</segment> 
<segment id='502' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This last version will be more or less merge together 
and after that you will upload the version 
with your specific changes about the color section for example, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='503' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, more or less this is the basic idea.</segment> 
<segment id='504' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm explaining this like a very simple thing okay 
but this is something that we will see how to how to do it okay in the future okay.</segment> 
<segment id='505' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, the first use that you are going to to have of this git tool is a personal use okay.</segment> 
<segment id='506' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, in principle you are not going to have conflict or problem 
but as soon as we progress in the course, you, a couple will in will be working in parallel in the same problem okay.</segment> 
<segment id='507' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you will need to be very careful with that step 
and we will see how to solve solve the typical situation.</segment> 
<segment id='508' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Are you understanding me?</segment> <segment id='509' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yep. Okay.</segment> 
<segment id='510' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is I think this is a good slide to represent the different steps that we have here.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='511' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So we are working with something that this is located in the remote, okay, place.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='512' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And typically, we are doing something that is okay.</segment> 
<segment id='513' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I want to get a local copy doing doing the clone,
and after that we can add local themes.</segment> 
<segment id='514' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, as soon as we implement the hit commit, or we execute the git commit, 
this information is stored stored in our local repository, 
making the push, we we will, we are doing that available in the remote repository.</segment> 
<segment id='515' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, if you want to have the latest version of the report, 
you need to implement the git pull.</segment> 
<segment id='516' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And as soon as the system detects any kind of issue or problem, 
because you are modifying the same file, 
or there are any kind of conflict, 
we will work with something that we will discuss next week 
about the concept of Git merge 
and the checkout more additional functionalities that are available in this in the store.</segment> 
<segment id='517' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so today is something related only to conference.</segment> 
<segment id='518' features='semantic-density;sd+'>My proposal, please use GitHub, sorry, Bitbucket create there a repository, 
create first create an account to log into the account, 
create your first repository</segment>, 
<segment id='519' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and please add Miguel Ángel and myself, if you want, of course, 
to share these with with us to see what is your evolution or their progress with the things.</segment> 
<segment id='520' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, so what is the first step to install so in the in the Windows computer, 
you have already installed the git client for for the ubuntu operating system, 
you need to execute this, 
so you have the virtual machine available for you.</segment> 
<segment id='521' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And the virtual machine in this moment does doesn't have the, the the git installed.</segment> 

[75:00]

<segment id='522' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So if you want to install the git, you only, you only need to execute that command.</segment> 
<segment id='523' features='semantic-density;sd++'>This is something that means you have super user rights APD installed git tools.</segment> 
<segment id='524' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, with that you install the commander, 
there are some graphical versions of the tools.</segment> 
<segment id='525' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But in our first stage, I don't recommend the use of the graphical tools 
until you have a basic knowledge of the things that you are doing.</segment> 
<segment id='527' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so forgot to use these graphical versions, I prefer that you use the code, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='528' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And for example, if you want to clone a repository is something simple, 
because you open a terminal and you execute git clone.</segment> 
<segment id='529' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then address of the repository, typically, 
you'll need a log in and a password unless the repository is public.</segment>
 <segment id='530' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And you can download the local copy to your computer.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='531' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So with that, the steps are very simple, we create an empty folder.</segment> 
<segment id='532' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We implement or we execute the git clone, the repository already exists.</segment> 
<segment id='533' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And using the command git add, I'm adding files to the local file to this to the repository.</segment> 
<segment id='534' features='semantic-density;sd++'>With git commit, I boot, I boot the data changes in the local repository.</segment> 
<segment id='535' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And finally, executing git push we are publishing or making available, the changes to the remote repository.</segment> <segment id='536' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Great. 
So more or less, four, five commands, to do the basic or to implement the basic steps.</segment> 
<segment id='537' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so my proposal very simple proposal to start playing with this, 
my recommendation is start playing with it.</segment> 
<segment id='538' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Create Your Account when when you prefer the the place that you you want, 
create your first repository, 
put some environment variables that are mandatory, 
invite Miguel Ángel and myself to use these.</segment> 
<segment id='539' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Start playing with these basic commands,</segment> 
<segment id='540' features='semantic-density;sd--'>with stupid files only with simple test to see the evolution of the things that you are doing.</segment> 
<segment id='541' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And play with Git add, git commit, git push, git pull and all these command to start understanding the idea.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='542' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And have a look to this.</segment> 
<segment id='543' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Only as something that is very introductory and something to start playing with.</segment> Okay? 
<segment id='544' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Don't worry about that.</segment> 
<segment id='545' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Play with this and next week we can discuss about the concepts again.</segment> 
<segment id='546' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, because this is new, 
and probably the first time that you play with this 
is a little bit confusing or difficult to understand.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='547' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So I think we are on time.</segment> <segment id='548' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, we have, we have finished the presentations.</segment> 
<segment id='549' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Do you have any big question, big problem or theme to discuss?</segment> No? <segment id='550' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Everything is clear?</segment> 

[79:00]

<segment id='551' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so
Session 3
One second.</segment> <segment id='552' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So what's the purpose of this?</segment> 
<segment id='553' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay this is a USB Wi Fi that will be used 
when you are working working here in the lab or at home</segment> 
<segment id='554' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and you have a virtual machine running Ubuntu, okay.</segment> 
<segment id='555' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The idea is to connect to a Wi Fi using this.</segment> 
<segment id='556' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so here in the lab we will have a specific Wi Fi access point with no connection to internet, 
because the only that we are going to do is here 
</segment><segment id='557' features='semantic-density;sd+'>we are going to install here like a network sensor.</segment> 
<segment id='558' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, sensor network, no more than that, but no connection to the Internet.</segment> 
<segment id='560' features='semantic-density;sd++'>The idea is that with this Wi Fi connection, 
you can there you have the option to connect to the Raspberry Pi, okay, 
of course, using the Wi Fi network provided by this Wi Fi router.</segment> 
<segment id='561' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But again, with no access to internet.</segment> 
<segment id='562' features='semantic-density;sd++'>In the Windows computer, the same computer that is running the Ubuntu virtual machine 
you have there the Ethernet connection 
and this Ethernet connection, of course, has access to the external world, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='563' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you can download things and follow all the things that you want to do okay.</segment> 

[80:00]

<segment id='564' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, take a picture of these, and take these into account 
and in a Moodle site you have different pictures 
with the suggested configurations that should be used at home okay.</segment> 
<segment id='565' features='semantic-density;sd++'>But be careful with this 
because as soon as you connect to this Wi Fi that has no access to internet 
you cannot download software to the virtual machine, 
you cannot connect to any external place okay, 
you can only communicate with a Raspberry Pi.</segment> Okay. 
<segment id='566' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, what is the purpose of this cable?</segment> 
<segment id='567' features='semantic-density;sd++'>This is a USB to serial line interface.</segment> <segment id='568' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, it's this.</segment> 
<segment id='569' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And what's the purpose?</segment> 
<segment id='570' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The first time that you connect the Raspberry Pi to the Wi Fi probably, you'll fail.</segment> Why? 
<segment id='571' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Because you have an incorrect identification SSID</segment> 
<segment id='572' features='semantic-density;sd-'>or the password is wrong or whatever problem you have.</segment> Okay? 
<segment id='573' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, using this interface using a serial line, 
you can connect to the Raspberry Pi using a terminal 
typically you put the program and you can verify that this Linux is working properly.</segment> 
<segment id='574' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I made the phrases correctly configured.</segment> 
<segment id='575' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so that's the purpose of this cable, okay: 
to connect the USB in my personal computer or in the lab computer to the Raspberry Pi okay?</segment> 
<segment id='576' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is the power supply.</segment> 
<segment id='577' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Please use always this power supply.</segment> 
<segment id='578' features='semantic-density;sd++'>I don't want to see the Raspberry Pi connected to your power adapter used to charge your mobile phone 
or connect the Raspberry Pi to the USB block available in the computer 
because you will have problems with the hardware okay 
and you can damage the hardware 
so please use always this power supply.</segment> Okay? Okay. 
<segment id='579' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You have here the accelerometer in two weeks you will have the color sensor.</segment> 
<segment id='580' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, and you have the Raspberry Pi with a XX.</segment> Okay. <segment id='581' features='semantic-density;sd--'>That's all. Questions?</segment> 
<segment id='582' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Next week: homeworks install the Raspbian, 
ask about the questions that I raised before about this collection of questions with answers.</segment> 
<segment id='583' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, I will open a task in Moodle you will have to submit before next class, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='584' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And please, I encourage you to have a look at the ideas of how to manage git, okay, 
to interact with the use of Github or BitBucket 
or the tool that you prefer to develop our first XX</segment> 
one additional thing: will always use the same place you are now sit on okay? Why? Why?
<segment id='585' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We have the virtual machines 
and we don't want that you turn on the virtual machines in all the computers 
because in that case we will be running out of space, okay, 
and I don't want to have problems with that.</segment> Okay? 
<segment id='586' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In Moodle you have the virtual machine available to be downloaded, 
so if you connect to the Moodle site, 
you can download the virtual machine 
and you can play at home with a virtual machine.</segment> 
<segment id='587' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, this is actually the same file that you have locally, okay, 
but please use always the same position, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='588' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And one option is that as you have to generate couples to work together probably, 
you can follow this organization 
but if you want to organize the themes think about it at the beginning of the next class 
we can reorganize the couple okay?</segment> 
<segment id='589' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Everything is clear?</segment> Okay. <segment id='590' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay thank you very much!</segment> 

[83:00]

<segment id='591' features='semantic-density;sd-'>See you
Session 4
This is a tool to help us to develop</segment>
<segment id='592' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Or control the development of our software application</segment>
<segment id='593' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK it's a very interesting tool</segment>
<segment id='594' features='semantic-density;sd-'>To track the evolution of the code 
and the other day we were doing we were explaining 
different simple things about the basic commands 
about the basic functionalities that we have to manage</segment> 
<segment id='595' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The basic functions of git OK
So the idea today is to start giving
Additional information thinking on a collaborative use of this
OK what's the goal of this
In principle you are going to work in couples</segment>
<segment id='596' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And the idea is that you are going to develop a project</segment>
<segment id='597' features='semantic-density;sd--'>In couples</segment> <segment id='598' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK
So the idea is that in principle you're going to work together</segment>
<segment id='599' features='semantic-density;sd+'>On the same project
and you are going to add remove
And make different changes in the code
Using git okay?</segment>
<segment id='600' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So that's the idea of this
I think it's very interesting to Start learning this now
Because probably at least the students of this school have not experienced using this 
and it's very complicated if not impossible to control the evolution of the code 
with folders and versions of the same file 
it's impossible to maintain and impossible to control 
it's impossible to fix errors and to give you some feedback</segment> <segment id='601' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
so the proposal is all of your projects should be managed using git OK 
for me it's not an issue if you if you want to use instead of Bitbucket GitHub 
or whatever git in the cloud that you want to use no problem with that 
the only point is that if you want to share with Miguel Angel and myself the project 
in order to track the evolution of your code OK?</segment> 

[85:00]

<segment id='602' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK so what are the things that we know until now?</segment> 
<segment id='603' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In principle the other day we were talking about how to initialize our repository</segment> <segment id='604' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
how to download a copy of that repository
thing that we didn't define as the clone operation 
how to do local changes in my files 
and once that I consider that that code is ready for something</segment> 
<segment id='605' features='semantic-density;sd++'>I'm doing local saves or local copies of that code 
and I perform commit to my local repository 
and after that I send my local copy of the repository out to the GitHub GitLab or Bitbucket 
or the application that you want to use using push OK?</segment> 
<segment id='606' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So basically we create a new report 
or are we copy a report that is available somewhere 
and do a copy of that 
I change the source code locally 
and as soon as I want to save that change locally 
I use the git commit command 
once that I've already completed that command 
I publish the changes in the cloud version or the remote repository using push OK?</segment> 
<segment id='607' features='semantic-density;sd++'>and if we want to have the last version of the code
that's available in the remote repository we used the pull command okay?</segment>
<segment id='608' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So let me show you this in a very simple way okay?</segment>
<segment id='609' features='semantic-density;sd++'>OK I'm going to log in on Bitbucket
So I have here this report this report I created this morning 
it's a very simple report for doing the test OK and it's available in Bitbucket 
the first operation that I'm going to perform is to execute a clone of the report</segment>
<segment id='610' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Si I go here, and in clone I get a command that is I
Let me one second to create here a folder RPi
I'm going to open here a console 
and I'm going to execute the command git clone okay</segment>
<segment id='611' features='semantic-density;sd+'>With that I am accessing my report 
and I am performing a local copy of the remote repository okay?</segment>
<segment id='612' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So now I have here a folder with the code with different files okay?</segment> 
<segment id='613' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In principle with one file sorry I use an editor OK 
I can see the content of the file</segment> <segment id='615' features='semantic-density;sd-'>OK 
it's a very very simple file</segment> <segment id='616' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK 
So what happens if I perform here some modification?</segment> 
<segment id='617' features='semantic-density;sd-'>we are going to do a very very simple modification 
for instance creating a new file 
and we are going to assign a value 
I'm going to save the changes</segment> <segment id='618' features='semantic-density;sd++'>OK 
and if I execute git status sorry git status 
you can see here that there is a file that is already modified OK 
so we are going to do execute the at command 
that means that aren't changes to the local repository 
the file is added if I check again the status the file is already saved in the local stage
or or the local stash copy of the repository okay?</segment> 

[90:00]

<segment id='619' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Once I decide that this file is ready to be shared with my colleague 
is ready to do something with it 
I'm going to execute a commit command 
and in a message try to put always a meaningful (tag) 
we are going to add that file to my local repository 
and once we have that what we are going to do 
is to execute a push of that file in the remote repository okay?</segment> 
<segment id='620' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So now if I navigate directly to the report and I update the report</segment> 
<segment id='621' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I will see here in the left part the commit 
and I have here the last changes that we have done in our file okay?</segment> 
<segment id='622' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And additionally you can track the changes that have been doing this morning 
which I did the initial commit and modification and some things that I've been doing okay?</segment>
<segment id='623' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So if you use this the advantage you will have is that you can track the evolution of your code</segment> <segment id='624' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
So, the basics
From the report create local changes add local changes
Perform a commit of these changes to the local repository with a message push 
to publish that content in the remote repository okay?</segment>
<segment id='625' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So what happens if my colleague is working with a report 
and wants to have a copy of the last version of the report?</segment>
<segment id='626' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In that case we have the command pull</segment> <segment id='627' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
to bring to my computer a remote copy to the local repository okay?</segment>
<segment id='628' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So this means that if you are working together on the same project 
you need to be in phase to avoid problems 
as we will see later how to solve OK 
this is the basic things that we are going to use 
so my expectation our expectation in the first part of the course 
or at least you manage these commands 
and then to keep a copy of your project and to follow to track the project okay?</segment>
<segment id='629' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And with this we can avoid the typical things that 
he was working yesterday today he's not working 
I don't know why I have the things in this other folder 
this kind of things should be avoided using this strategy of using git OK?</segment> 
<segment id='630' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And this is the basic view but of course this is yeah this is the getting started of git 
but git has more has additional functionalities that are very very interesting 
and the first one is the concept of a branch 
what means that that means that when we are developing software in one specific point 
I can say to my colleague please implement this specific functionality 
read this register from the accelerometer</segment> <segment id='631' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
my colleague instead of working with the main or the principal or the master branch of the code 
is going to create another branch 
a branch is really like a copy that is a pointer to the last version of the code 
and we are going to assign a specific name to that branch 
for instance typically devel feature 
and a name whatever you can imagine 
but something with some something that is important for you 
don't put a useless name 
because it's quite difficult to track the thing okay?</segment> 
<segment id='632' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So this means that if you create a branch  
you switch to that branch 
and you perform the modifications in that branch 
once that you check that that part of the code is working 
your colleague can bring that changes to their branch OK?</segment> 

[95:00]

<segment id='633' features='semantic-density;sd-' comment='merge'>And this is something that we typically call merge 
merge is like we are mixing the things okay?</segment> 
<segment id='634' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In principle if you are developing one thing and your colleague is developing another thing 
when you perform the merge typically there are no problems or issues 
and the point here is that two developers are doing the same thing 
in that case we have the typical thing that we call conflicts</segment> <segment id='635' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK 
this is the thing that you should avoid 
so the idea is that at the end of the course 
when you are developing the main project of the course.</segment>
<segment id='636' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You use this idea of branches to more or less organise the development of the code
Are you understanding me yeah?</segment> 
<segment id='637' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK can you hear me there at the end yeah?</segment>
<segment id='639' features='semantic-density;sd-' comment='metaphor'>What is a branch?</segment> 
<segment id='640' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So a branch is a line of development 
it's quite easy to create a branch 
if we move to the Bitbucket we can go to this place branch 
and we can create here a branch 
you see for instance taking as input the main branch 
I can create a branch that we call devel</segment> <segment id='641' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
and at this point we have two branches of the code 
as soon as we move to the local repo 
and we execute the command git fetch 
which means something to search for changes in the remote repo 
this is going to discover that there is a new branch that is called devel okay?</segment> 
<segment id='642' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And we can change to that branch you see in the command 
you check out and the name of the branch OK 
and if I execute this here always git status 
we can see always here in this part the name of the branch where we are okay?</segment> 
<segment id='643' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So now if we perform here modifications in the file okay 
and my colleague is adding a new function okay?</segment> 
<segment id='644' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I can save that to the local stash 
I can create a commit with a new function OK 
and I can push this to the remote repository to the branch devel okay?</segment> 
<segment id='645' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So now if we move to here to my remote repo 
here we are in the main sorry
if we have a look at the content of the file</segment> 
<segment id='646' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I don't have here the changes 
because the changes are in the branch that we have called colleague devel, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='647' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and it's quite simple to manage okay
if you do the things in an intelligent way okay 
that is a branch OK 
what are the typical names of the branches?</segment> 
<segment id='648' features='semantic-density;sd-' comment='use of language'>Typically &quot;main&quot; so master was the old definition 
but with these new times 
that we are avoiding words that can be or can offend to other guys or other people 
master is never used any more and we are using main OK?</segment>
<segment id='649' features='semantic-density;sd+'>devel typically is where we are developing things
and main is always like the release version of the code 
the final product that we are going to have OK 
so with this organization you can create an intelligent evolution of the code 
ways to create branches and to change from one branch to another 
using the command git check out 
with that you change the branch that you are using</segment> 

[100:00]

<segment id='650' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
and with git status git status you can verify in which branch you are 
for instance here executing git status 
we can see that we are in the master branch OK 
that's the old definition now it's the main branch 
that means that here we have a new file 
and the file that we have deleted okay?</segment> 
<segment id='651' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and files that are in traffic?</segment>
<segment id='652' features='semantic-density;sd+'>these are files that are not controlled by Github.</segment> 
<segment id='653' features='semantic-density;sd+'>what is the mechanism to use git branches?</segment> 
<segment id='654' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So the procedure is we change from a specific branch with the command check out OK 
we put the last changes of that branch with pull 
we are doing a copy of the remote repo so a local repo OK 
with that we are discovering the last changes</segment> <segment id='655' features='semantic-density;sd-'>OK 
and we are doing that changes locally okay?</segment> 
<segment id='656' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And finally if we want to move some specific content of one branch to another 
so this means we want to move the changes that we have in the devel branch 
to the master branch or to the main branch 
what we execute is this command git merge okay?</segment> 
<segment id='657' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And when you are merging the problem could be that you have conflicts</segment> <segment id='659' features='semantic-density;sd-'>OK 
because two developers are modifying the same function 
or even two developers are changing the same line of code 
that is something that you should avoid okay?</segment> 
<segment id='660' features='semantic-density;sd--'>In the next slide we have you have a description of the problem</segment> <segment id='661' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
please have a look to that and basically what happens is the following 
when you execute the merge if everything is correct 
because there is no conflict 
you will see something like this you are mixing the code no problem 
what happens if there is an error?</segment> 
<segment id='663' features='semantic-density;sd-'>If it's impossible to merge?</segment> 
<segment id='664' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In that case you see a message saying you that there are conflicts 
and you need to solve that conflict OK 
so that means that you have to compare files 
and select which is the appropriate code which you want finally maintain</segment> <segment id='665' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
imagine that he defines the variable A and you define the variable B 
you put that in the same line of code 
and the problem is you have to decide if you want variable A or variable B 
it's as simple as that 
typical tools to resolve conflicts 
I recommend that when you are working in Linux you use Mel 
Mel is a very interesting tool to compare source files</segment> <segment id='666' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
you can see on the screen the source files 
and you can compare line by line the content of the file 
and you can move things from one file to another</segment> 
<segment id='667' features='semantic-density;sd--'>On the contrary</segment> <segment id='668' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK it's quite useful and in GitHub 
if you have the mel installed you can invoke mel using this merge tool 
when you do that typically you see something like this a graphical tool</segment> <segment id='669' features='semantic-density;sd-'>with the different files 
in order to select what is the final code that you want to have 
and you can move things from one file to another okay?</segment> 
<segment id='670' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This is the file in a specific branch that is going to be merged 
this is the resulting file 
this is the current content that we have in the local repository 
and moving things we can select finally in this file what is the final content</segment> <segment id='672' features='semantic-density;sd-'>OK 
the real thing for you is that when you are doing this 
unless that you are doing the same modifications 
we never have conflicts again unless that you are changing the same things okay?</segment> 
<segment id='674' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Please have a look to the slides to understand this correctly 
I recommend you this address OK 
to download these graphical representations of the meaning of the different commands</segment> 
<segment id='675' features='semantic-density;sd+'>that we are using in GitHub sorry in git to manage the use of the repos</segment> 

[105:00]

<segment id='676' features='semantic-density;sd--'>OK 
it is interesting to understand graphically the things that you are doing.</segment> 
<segment id='677' features='semantic-density;sd+'>How to discover remote changes is something 
that I have already executed on my computer with git merge 
how to merge</segment> <segment id='678' features='semantic-density;sd-'>have a look to that OK 
and the first time that you have an issue tell me 
and I will help you to understand how to solve the conflicts 
and these kind of things, okay?</segment>
<segment id='680' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Useful things please use commit with meaningful messages</segment> 
<segment id='679' features='semantic-density;sd--'>don't put version one version two version three that has no sense 
this is a version that is reading the registers and is working or is not working 
and it is not working because there is this problem 
something that is meaningful for the reviewer or your classmate or for you OK 
so try to organize your development in different characteristics or features</segment> <segment id='681' features='semantic-density;sd++'>OK 
for instance if we have if we have to develop the accelerometer 
and we want to do something with the Y axis acceleration 
you can perform one push and for that this can be a branch 
you can create another branch to develop something to read the speed of variation of a specific axis 
so whatever you can imagine please organize that in different branches 
to see how you are evoluting the code 
try to push in the branches in the devel branch code 
that is already compiling linked and typically working</segment> <segment id='682' features='semantic-density;sd+'>OK 
and with that you will avoid problems in the future 
and push to master only a stable version</segment> 
<segment id='683' features='semantic-density;sd-'>this will be what Miguel Ángel and myself will be evaluating 
and doing the assessment in the different parts of the code, okay?</segment> 
<segment id='684' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So more or less different branches to develop things 
when you are sure that that specific thing is working move to devel 
and once you consider that all your software is ready 
move to the master or the main branch, okay?</segment>
